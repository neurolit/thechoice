    You have been selected for a routine aptitude test.

    As you surely know, the regulation code dictates that all human
    specimens be regularly checked for basic survival abilities.
    
- type: text
  text: >
    Your ability to perform logic will be evaluated. You will be given a fair
    shot at remaining an active member of society.

    Do not disappoint.

- type: clear

    For the purpose of this evaluation, you will be entering code in the
    area below.

    From now on, you will stop moving your humanoid limbs around and use
    only the keyboard to progress further.

    That could have been an accident. Do it again.

    Do not smile. You are not really a fast learner.
